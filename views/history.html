        <h1>Overview</h1>
        <p>
          The Duquesne Incline is a historic funicular railway in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, that has been in operation since 1877. It was originally constructed to transport workers who lived on Mount Washington down to the factories and mills along the Monongahela River. At the time, Pittsburgh’s steep hills made commuting difficult, and inclines like Duquesne (along with others) provided a practical solution. The incline was designed by Samuel Diescher, a renowned engineer known for his work on multiple funiculars across the U.S.
          By the mid-20th century, as automobiles and roads became more common, the incline faced potential closure. However, in 1963, a community-led restoration effort saved it, ensuring its continued operation. Today, it serves as both a historic landmark and a practical form of public transit, offering breathtaking views of downtown Pittsburgh.
